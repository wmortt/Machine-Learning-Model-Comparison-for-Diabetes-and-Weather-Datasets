# Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison-for-Diabetes-and-Weather-Datasets
This project compares the performance of Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and KNN on two datasets: Diabetes and Weather. The goal is to evaluate and identify the models that achieve the best accuracy, precision, and recall for each dataset.
